# Async Redux for React

Async Redux is a new, unofficial version of Redux, launched in July 2024 for React.

While it's new for React, it has been
available for [Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/async_redux) for a few years, where it ranks among
the top 8% of most-used packages, meaning its features have been battle-tested in hundreds of
real-world applications.

It is an order of magnitude easier to use than Redux and Redux Toolkit. It's also simpler than MobX,
without being as barebones as Zustand.
It comes with everything you need, to ensure that even its advanced features are easy to use.
And it plays well with state created with both JavaScript objects and ES6 classes.

Documentation is coming in late July 2024.
